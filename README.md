# KLM Assignment

This is my KLM assignment, I had a lot of fun creating this repository.

It was my first time using GraphQL so I learned a lot

My assumption is that KLM uses a (self maintained) design library. Therefor I included the CSS Library Bulma to mimic that.

Please login with flightnumber = `PZIGZ3`

Please note that because of time constraints, I put not that much effort into the Flight Details page. I only used Bulma elements to quickly display the data

## Installation

Use the npm install command to begin the installation of the project

```bash
npm install
```

I use `lerna` to both start the backend and frontend projects, by running

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

This project uses:
- Lerna
- Cypress Component Testing
- Angular 14 (not 15 :))
- GraphQL Apollo with `apollo-angular`
- Bulma (pure) CSS Library
- Prettier

## Improvements

Things that I wanted to implement but did not have time for
- Frontend mocking
- Get more data from json file
- Semantics of flight-details page
- Enrichment of data of flight-details page
