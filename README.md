# KLM Assignment

This is the introduction text for the assignment

## Installation

Use the npm install command to begin the installation of the project

```bash
npm install
```

I use `lerna` to both start the backend and frontend projects, by running

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

```javascript
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')
```

This project uses:
- Lerna
- Cypress Component Testing
- Angular 14 (not 15 :))
- GraphQL Apollo with `apollo-angular`
- Bulma (pure) CSS Library
- Prettier
- 

Things that I wanted to implement but did not have time for
- Frontend mocking
- BEM integration
